Compiling: using the included Makefile (works the same as previously provided class Makefiles)
	make - compiles lib_info.cpp 
	make test - compiles and runs ./gradeall
	make clean - removes lib_info executable

Eric- created the library storage system
Travis - created the logic for printing

These were our primary focuses but we both worked on both aspects of the project especially when the other
partner got stuck.
